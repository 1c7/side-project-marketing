One of the most effective ways to encourage repeat visitors to your side project, to engage paying customers, and to improve conversion rates is to get people to sign up with their email address.

Sure, we may spend more time scanning Facebook and Reddit for interesting bits of news, but nothing is quite as direct as email marketing. It can also be great for users who want to keep up with your product, but don't want to set a reminder to come back every week and check on it. So, how do you go about building an email list and sending regular updates?

## Email Marketing Tools

The great thing about email marketing tools like these are that **you can start building an audience without a completed product or service.** You don't have to know how to write email-compliant HTML ([which involves lots of tables and is a huge pain](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-code-html-email-newsletters/)), you don't have to have an email server, and you (usually) don't have to write any code.

Here's a rundown of email marketing tools and a little bit about some of them.

- **[ActiveCampaign](http://www.activecampaign.com/)**

- **[ActiveTrail](https://www.activetrail.com/email_marketing_software/)**

- **[Autopilot](https://autopilothq.com/)** - This probably goes beyond just an email marketing tool, but it can be helpful for that as well. Autopilot lets you set up automated marketing campaigns to customers across channels.

- **[Aweber](https://www.aweber.com/)**

- **[Benchmark Email](https://www.benchmarkemail.com/)**

- **[Buttondown](https://buttondown.email)** - Buttondown lets you write emails in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). That's pretty awesome.

- **[Cakemail](https://www.cakemail.com/)**

- **[Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/c/)**

- **[Campaigner](http://www.campaigner.com/)**

- **[Charley](https://charley.io/)**

- **[Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com/home/signup.jsp)**

- **[Convertkit](https://convertkit.com/)** - This one is good if you're primarily using your email newsletter to promote your blog.

- **[Drip](https://www.drip.co/)** - Drip helps you build sales automation email flows. This looks interesting although I haven't personally tried it.

- **[Email Monster](https://emailmonster.io/)** - A free drag-and-drop email editor.

- **[Flashissue](https://www.flashissue.com/)** - Unlike most email creators, Flashissue works with Gmail, so you don't even have to leave your inbox to send out newsletters. It's a novel approach to email marketing that I'm excited to try, plus it's free.

- **[GetResponse](https://www.getresponse.com/)**

- **[Google MailApp Scripts](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/mail/mail-app)** - This is kind of an unconventional option, but if you're a developer, you might like working with the command line rather than a GUI. Google's MailApp API could be perfect for you.

- **[FreshMail](https://freshmail.com/)**

- **[iContact](https://www.icontact.com/pricing)**

- **[Litmus](http://litmus.com/)**

- **[Mad Mimi](https://madmimi.com/)** - I've used Mad Mimi as a lower cost alternative to Mailchimp, but I'm not as keen on their email creation UI.

- **[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) ([use this link for $30 credit](http://eepurl.com/cMDrn5))** - You may have heard about them in a podcast advertisement, but Mailchimp is great for a number of reasons. Their email template builder is simple to use and they have a [generous free tier for up to 2000 subscribers](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/).

- **[MailGet](https://www.formget.com/mailget-app/)**

- **[Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)** - Mailgun is an api-only email sending tool, so if your service needs to send transactional emails or you prefer writing your emails in [vim](http://www.vim.org/), Mailgun is for you.

- **[Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/)**

- **[Mailshake](https://mailshake.com/)** - Especially for cold email outreach.

- **[Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/)** - Mautic offers a whole suite of open source marketing automation software. I still haven't tried it, but I've heard good things.

- **[MixMax](https://mixmax.com/)**

- **[ReachMail](https://www.reachmail.net/)**

- **[Retainly](https://retainly.co/)**

- **[Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/)** - Sendgrid has long been my go-to for api-driven email, and now you can actually create campaigns and templates in Sendgrid as well.

- **[Sendy](https://sendy.co/)** - A great bargain option that is backed by [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).

- **[Sumo](https://sumo.com/)** - Helps by emphasizing better email capture through popups.

- **[ToutApp](https://www1.toutapp.com/)**

- **[Vertical Response](http://www.verticalresponse.com/)**

- **[Yesware](http://www.yesware.com/)**
