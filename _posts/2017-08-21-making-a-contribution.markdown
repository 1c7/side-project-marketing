If you've stumbled on this project from somewhere on the internet, then welcome! While the original [side project marketing checklist](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/marketing-checklist/) was my project, dozens of people have made suggestions for improving the project, and a few have even [helped make changes](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing/graphs/contributors). The community is what makes a project like this succeed in the long-run, so I hope that you will help the project improve by making updates and suggestions.

We're able to keep the checklist organized by [hosting it on Github](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing). Github is a popular tool for open source projects, but if you're not familiar with it, that's okay. You can still contribute to the project, and here's how:

## 1. Get Familiar with the Checklist

Before you make a suggestion or submit a change, please take a few minutes and ask yourself these questions:

- **Has an issue already been created?** On Github, we keep a running lists of "[issues](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing/issues)," or ideas to improve the checklist. Before you make a suggestion, see if there's already an issue open for your topic area.

- **What about the blog?** I'm working on moving common requests and lists of services to [the blog](https://www.sideprojectchecklist.com/blog/), so be sure to see if your improvement might be a better fit for a blog post. If so, you can contribute (see the three methods below) or open an issue to improve an existing blog post.

- **Will it benefit other side projects?** Finally, keep in mind the spirit and audience of the checklist. This list is for people who need help marketing their casual side projects. Services that cost thousands of dollars per month are probably not appropriate. That said, self-promotion of a project you maintain is okay so long as it's appropriate for our audience.

## 2. Make or Suggest an Update

There are three ways that you can contribute to the Side Project Marketing Checklist. While I would prefer Github issues or pull requests, I will respond to email suggestions as well.

### Method 1: Fork and Pull Request

The quickest way to improve the checklist is to use your Github account to [fork this repository and make a pull request](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/). This is much easier for me as I can review your change and approve it or give you feedback right from the platform.

### Method 2: Create an Issue

If you aren't sure what the fix would be or you'd like to have a conversation about something before you create a pull request, then [add an issue to this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). This allows other community members to join the conversation and discuss the idea before anybody spends time on it.

### Method 3: Email Me

Finally, if you're not on Github or unsure how to use it, that's okay! Just send me an email to [marketing@portablecto.com](mailto:marketing@portablecto.com). If it's something that's worth discussing I may open an issue for you, otherwise, I will work with you to make the update.

## Some Ideas for Contributing

If you'd like to make a contribution, but you're not sure how, here are a few ideas to get you started:

- **Take a look at the issues.** If there are any you can help with, go for it!

- **Write a blog post.** Marketing tips, stories of how you marketed your side project, interviews with people who run side projects, or lists of related resources are all appropriate for the blog.

- **Create a new list of similar marketing services.** If you've had the chance to try or evaluate several similar services and you'd like to share your findings, please do. We'd love to hear from you.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to building the community with you!
