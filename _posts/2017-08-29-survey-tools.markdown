Collecting surveys from your users or potential users is one of the best ways to gauge how and why they're interested in your product. Sometimes you may be surprised by what you learn, but more often, surveys are a great way to identify your strongest advocates and highlight their happiness.

While developers can easily build forms to capture customer responses, it's usually much faster to use an off-the-shelf product or service. Below we've collected some of our favorite options.

### All Survey and Form Tools

- **[Contactr](https://contactr.io/)**

- **[Formspree](https://formspree.io/)** - This has quickly become my favorite way to handle contact forms, but you can also use it embed a form on any static website. The responses are emailed to you as they come in, and it's free. 

- **[Google Consumer Surveys](https://www.google.com/analytics/surveys/)** - If you want to poll the general public, Google Surveys let you start as low as 10 cents per response.

- **[Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/)** - Google Forms is simple, free, and it integrates into Google Sheets, allowing you to capture data right where you can use it.

- **[IdeaCheck](http://www.ideacheck.io)** - Helps you validate your ideas and will even find respondents for your survey.

- **[LimeSurvey](https://github.com/LimeSurvey/LimeSurvey)**

- **[MicroHero Surveys](https://www.microhero.com/surveys/)** - Focused on mobile. Allows you to create surveys for your customers or they'll help you find respondents.

- **[Picklelist](http://pickle.monkeytest.it/)** - Great for conducting quick polls and giving your audience a look at the results.

- **[SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/)**

- **[TellForm](https://www.tellform.com/)**

- **[Twitter Polls](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2015/introducing-twitter-polls.html)** - If you have a significant Twitter following, these are a great way to get responses to your questions.

- **[Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/)**

- **[Wufoo Forms](https://www.wufoo.com/gallery/templates/surveys/)** - Wufoo is one of my favorite embeddable forms because you can also handle integrations with services like Mailchimp, Google Sheets, and Stripe. This makes your forms really dynamic.
