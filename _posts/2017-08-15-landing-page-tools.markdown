One challenge that every side project has is attracting and engaging users. Whether your side project is an open source library, a software as a service, or a physical product, you need a way to quickly tell visitors about it and hook them into trying it. That's where a landing page comes in.

A good landing page helps visitors quickly determine whether or not your product is right for them, and if it is, the landing page should direct them to take an action. Depending on what it is you're promoting, your landing page might ask for an email signup, encourage a file download, or direct users to add something to their cart. Either way, you don't have to spend weeks coding your landing page from scratch. In fact, if you're a developer, I would encourage you to use a tool developed by marketers who know the best practices for landing pages rather than try to build your own.

## Landing Page Tools

Fortunately, there are many great and easy-to-use landing page generators and tools available. Some require a little knowledge of HTML and CSS, while others are completely non-tech friendly. Try a few of these tools out, and if you've got other landing page creation tools that we missed, please [leave your suggestions in this open issue on Github](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing/issues/12).

- **[Carrd](https://carrd.co/)** - Simple to use and free to get started.

- **[ClickFunnels](https://www.clickfunnels.com/)**

- **[Github Pages and Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/)** - If you don't mind writing a little HTML yourself, Jekyll is awesome. It can scale pretty much infinitely and it's free to use with Github pages.

- **[Gitlab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/04/07/gitlab-pages-setup/)** - If you prefer Gitlab to Github, this is a good option for landing page generation.

- **[HTML5 UP!](https://html5up.net/)** - Free HTML templates for landing pages.

- **[Instapage](https://instapage.com/)**

- **[Lander](https://landerapp.com/)**

- **[LandingFolio](http://www.landingfolio.com/)** - While LandingFolio isn't a tool for making landing pages, it does have a lot of examples you can use as inspiration for your landing page.

- **[Launchaco](http://launchaco.com/build/)**

- **[Launchrock](https://www.launchrock.com/)** - Really simple, but kind of limited because of that. Still, Launchrock is a good option when you just want to collect email addresses on a "Coming Soon" page.

- **[Leadpages](https://www.leadpages.net/welcome)**

- **[Neocities](https://neocities.org/)**

- **[ONTRApages](https://ontrapages.com/)**

- **[Rocketpages](http://www.rocketpages.net/)**

- **[Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)** - Squarespace is my go-to recommendation for non-technical people who need a website. Squarespace works just as well for basic landing pages as it does for a full-featured website and blog.

- **[Thrive Themes](https://thrivethemes.com/)** - If you use Wordpress, Thrive Themes has some great landing-page focused themes.

- **[Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/)** - Their editor gives you lots of options, plus they give you some analytics, the ability to A/B test, and much more.

- **[Wix](https://www.wix.com/)**

- **[Woobox](https://woobox.com/)**
