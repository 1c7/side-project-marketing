You may think that your side project stands alone - that it's truly unique in the market - but that's rarely true. In fact, no competition, might mean that your project just isn't necessary. If there's a market of people willing to buy your product, they're probably spending their money elsewhere today. Your job is to find out where.

Getting a lay of the competitive landscape can help you in many ways. Not only will you be prepared to compete better against established players, you'll learn how your rivals market their products, who their customers are, and how successful they've been. Researching your competition can also help you discover new niches for your side project that may be underserved, and if your project starts to gain traction, your competitors may end up being partners or even purchasers of your product.

That said, where do you start on this path to knowing your competition? What tools can you use to find and learn about your competitors? That's where this list can help you.

### All Competitor Research Tools

- **[Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/find-similar-sites)** - Alexa's similar site tool uses audience overlap rather than site content to determine similarity. 

- **[AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net)** - If you know your product is similar to at least one other site, you can use AlternativeTo to find dozens of alternatives to that site. 

- **[AngelList](https://angel.co/)** - Many startups create profiles on AngelList for hiring and promotional purposes, but you can also use it to learn about your competition and their history.

- **[CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/)** - See when companies were started, how much financing they received and who is leading them.

- **[Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts)** - Keeping up with mentions of your competitors in the news or blogs is easy with Google Alerts.

- **[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)** - Want to see what your competitors' websites looked like last month? A year ago? The Way Back Machine from archive.org has been storing old versions of websites since the 90's.

- **[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)** - If you're into startups, you have probably heard of Product Hunt. It helps you find new products by emailing newly submitted products every day (or week) and does a pretty good job categorizing submissions.

- **[ScoutZen](https://www.scoutzen.com)** - Use ScoutZen to track a competitor's followers/following on Twitter, as well as to monitor for mentions of your competition with automated advanced Twitter searches.

- **[SimilarSites](http://www.similarsites.com/)** - SimilarSites' search is pretty good at identifying competing sites in a specific niche.

- **[SimilarWeb](https://www.similarweb.com/)** - SimilarWeb can show you how your competition is getting traffic (eg: from social, SEO, or advertising).

- **[Sitegur](http://sitegur.com/)** - In addition to similar sites, Sitegur shows you traffic estimates for domains.

- **[SocialMention](http://www.socialmention.com/)** - SocialMention offers real-time social media search for keywords including domain names.

- **Trade Journals or Blogs** - For more traditional businesses, there is probably a trade journal out there. In new media, you might be more likely to find competitors mentioned in industry blogs or news sites.

- **[WebWire](https://www.webwire.com/IndustryList.asp)** - WebWire hosts a list of trade journals by industry that could be very helpful if you're exploring a new market and want to know what the major news sources are. 

- **[Whois Lookup](http://whois.domaintools.com/)** - This might be helpful for smaller competitors who don't include much information about the company's founders or structure on their site. Whois lookup allows you to see who owns the domain name, when it was bought/sold, and any other domains they own.
