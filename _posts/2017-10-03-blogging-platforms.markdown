There are many good reasons to start a blog for your side project: to update your customers, to generate content for marketing materials, or to establish yourself as a subject matter expert. The truth is that most companies use their blog for all three reasons, and whenever I start a new project, a blog is [one of the first things I do for marketing](/marketing-checklist).

Fortunately, setting up a blog doesn't have to be a headache, and there are numerous free or low-cost platforms that will help you build a professional looking one. Below I've collected a few of my favorites, but if you have your own suggestions, please let me hear about them!

### All Blogging Platforms

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Blogger">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Google’s free blogging platform is pretty low-frills, but it will get the job done. It can even be used on a custom domain.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="ButterCMS">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[ButterCMS](https://buttercms.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($24)</span> - If you’d prefer to use a CMS as a backend and integrate your blog into your site, an option like ButterCMS would work.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Contentful">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Like ButterCMS, Contentful can be used as a complete content management system with an API that will hook into your site. Both solutions are only recommended for developers.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Drupal">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Free, open source, PHP. Drupal is a full-fledged content management system with a huge community.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Ghost">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Ghost](https://ghost.org/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - An open source NodeJS blogging platform, Ghost can be installed on your server or you can use Ghost Pro to let them serve it up.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Jekyll">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - If you don’t mind writing a little HTML yourself, Jekyll is an awesome landing page and blogging platform. It can scale pretty much infinitely and it’s free to use with Github pages.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Linkedin_Publishing">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Linkedin Publishing](https://www.linkedin.com/post/new)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Linkedin has a publishing tool that allows anyone to write blog posts that are immediately shared with their Linkedin network and profile. You don’t get any options for customizing your posts or calls to action, but it’s simple and gets automatic distribution.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Medium">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Medium](https://medium.com/new-story)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Medium is really pushing its premium features for publishers lately, but the free option is still pretty good. You don’t get to customize the look of your blog, but it does get some free distribution on Medium.com.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Postach.io">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Postach.io](https://postach.io/site)** <span style="color: grey;">($9)</span> - Allows you to use Evernote as your blog's backend.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Postagon">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Postagon](http://www.postagon.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Many of the blogging platforms on this list have more features than Postagon, but if you like a clean, minimal experience, you can start writing on Postagon in less than a minute.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Squarespace">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($12)</span> - Squarespace is my go-to recommendation for non-technical people who need a website. Squarespace works just as well for basic landing pages as it does for a full-featured website and blog.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Tumblr">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Tumblr is simple and customizable, plus you can make it work with your own domain name.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Typepad">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Typepad](http://www.typepad.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($9)</span> - While Typepad is a popular option, it doesn’t offer a free plan, so you’ll need to pay at least $9/month for their service.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Weebly">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Weebly is a great all-in-one website and blog creator with many templates and tools to choose from.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Wix">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Wix](https://www.wix.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Wix gives you everything you need for a stunning website or blog and it's free.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Wordpress.com">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Wordpress.com is a hosted blogging service. It makes setup easier, but allows for less flexibility and includes fewer plugin options than Wordpress.org.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Wordpress.org">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - While you’ll have to install Wordpress on your own server, hosting is usually cheap. The biggest downside to Wordpress now is the spam that shows up because Wordpress is so popular.

- <a href="#vote-form" class="vote-link" rel="modal:open" id="Write.as">&#x25B2; <span class="count">0</span></a> &nbsp;**[Write.as](https://write.as/)** <span style="color: grey;">($0)</span> - Quick, free (or cheap to upgrade), does custom domains, custom CSS, and it’s easy to create a bunch of blogs from one account if you upgrade.
